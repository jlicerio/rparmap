- Added three non-AR marker examples for San Ygnacio: Trevino-Uribe Fort, San Ygnacio Plaza, and River Pierce Foundation Gallery.
- Updated the HTML/JS logic to only show the "Open AR Experience" button if an `ar_link` exists, both in the location list and map popups.

- AR-enabled locations now display a purple AR symbol (SVG) before the "Open AR Experience" text in both the location list and map popups.
- The symbol is styled for alignment and accessibility with an aria-label.
- Only AR-enabled locations show this symbol, making AR experiences visually distinct.

[index.html](index.html) is updated accordingly.

The AR marker symbol is now centered and sized to match the default marker placement, ensuring the tip of the marker aligns with the correct coordinates on the map. This should resolve the marker misplacement issue for AR-enabled locations. Non-AR markers remain unchanged. 

[index.html](index.html) is updated accordingly.

_**User**_

ar icon need more characterlooks a bit pllain any suggestions  

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are some suggestions to make the AR marker icon more visually distinctive and engaging:

1. **Add a 3D Cube or Camera Symbol:** Use a simple 3D cube or camera SVG next to or behind the "AR*" text to visually suggest augmented reality.
2. **Use a Gradient or Glow:** Add a subtle purple gradient or glow effect to the circle or star for a more modern, techy look.
3. **Incorporate a Sparkle or Starburst:** Add a small sparkle/starburst element to the icon to suggest something special or interactive.
4. **Use a Stylized “AR” Font:** Make the “AR” text bold, italic, or use a tech-style font for emphasis.
5. **Add a Shadow or Drop Effect:** Give the icon a slight shadow or drop effect to make it pop against the map.

Would you like to try a specific one of these, or combine a couple? For example, a 3D cube with a sparkle and a bold “AR” inside a purple circle. Let me know your preference, or I can provide a quick SVG mockup for you to review.

Mobile responsiveness is improved with a new media query for extra small screens (max-width: 480px). The header, title, and subtitle now stack and center, map and cards have better padding, font sizes are more readable, and buttons/popups are easier to tap. This ensures a more adaptive and user-friendly mobile experience.

Header, main title, and subtitle font sizes are now reduced and line heights tightened for small screens. The intro section (cross-hero) has increased top margin to ensure it's not hidden behind the header, and spacing is improved for better visibility and readability on mobile.

The header is now more compact on mobile: logo and text are smaller, stacked, and centered, with less padding and margin. The cross and main title are no longer overlapped or crowded by the header, and the intro is clearly visible. This ensures a clean, readable, and visually balanced mobile experience.

[index.html](index.html) is updated for optimal mobile header and intro layout.

- The mobile header now stacks logo, title, info button, and subtitle vertically, with spacing and centering for clarity.
- More margin is added below the header and above the cross/intro.
- The map now zooms to level 15 and centers on the average of all marker coordinates, providing a better regional view on load.

[index.html](index.html) is updated for a cleaner, less jumbled mobile experience and improved map focus.

The mobile header now uses a horizontal layout: logo, title, subtitle, and info button are all on one line, adaptively sized with vw units, and will shrink/wrap as needed. Text overflow is handled with ellipsis for long titles or subtitles. This ensures the header is compact, readable, and adaptive to screen size without stacking.

The AR marker is now aligned with the default marker by setting `anchor: 'bottom'` and `offset: [0, -4]`, and a drop-shadow filter has been added to the SVG for visual consistency. This ensures AR markers are precise and have a shadow like the default markers.

whats a more minimal short word or symbol we can use instead of using get directions 

---

_**Assistant**_

For a more minimal and clear alternative to "Get Directions," consider these options:

**Text Options:**
- **Directions**
- **Route**
- **Go**
- **Map**
- **To Here**
- **Guide**

**Symbol Options:**
- **🧭** (compass)
- **➡️** (right arrow)
- **📍** (location pin)
- **🗺️** (map)

A common minimal approach is to use just **"Directions"** or a **right arrow icon (➡️)**. For accessibility, you can use the icon with a visually hidden label, e.g.,  
`<span class="visually-hidden">Directions</span>`

Would you like to use a word, a symbol, or both? If you want a symbol, do you prefer an emoji or an SVG icon?
