_**User**_

the title did not chang it displays mixed reality map 

---

_**Assistant**_

To ensure the page title displays "Augmented Reality Map" instead of "Mixed Reality Map", update the `<title>` tag in your `index.html` file as follows:

```html:index.html
// ... existing code ...
  <title>Augmented Reality Map</title>
// ... existing code ...
```

Make sure this line is present and there are no duplicate or conflicting `<title>` tags elsewhere in the file. This will set the browser tab title to "Augmented Reality Map".

All visible references to "Mixed Reality Map" have been changed to "Augmented Reality Map" in the heading and modal content. The browser tab title is already set to "Augmented Reality Map". The issue should now be resolved.

  # Build & Change Log
+ 
+ ## Project Description
+ This project is an interactive Augmented Reality Map that allows users to discover and access AR experiences at historical sites. The map is web-based, mobile-friendly, and funded by THE RIVER PIERCE FOUNDATION. Each location on the map provides a direct link to an AR experience, which can be accessed via mobile device.
+ 
+ ## How It Works
+ - The map displays historical locations with AR content using Mapbox GL JS.
+ - Users can view details and addresses for each site, and open the AR experience via a provided link.
+ - A "Show My Location" button allows users to center the map on their current position.
+ - Directions from the user's location to any AR site can be generated using Mapbox Directions.
+ - The project is designed for easy expansion to new locations and AR experiences.
